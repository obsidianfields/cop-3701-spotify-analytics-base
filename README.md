# cop-3701-spotify-analytics-base
This analytics base aims to track various metrics for the streaming platform Spotify. Using a database of various songs across a diverse range of genres and artists, I aim to compare and contrast the popularity metrics over time for each genre, and, by extension, the most popular artists within each genre in terms of streaming count/popularity.
